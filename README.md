# Online Payment Fraud Detection

![Fraud Detection](https://i.imgur.com/A8PA1wB.jpeg)

This project is a machine learning model to detect fraudulent online payment transactions. By analyzing transactional data, the model can predict with a high degree of accuracy whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent. This helps in preventing financial loss and securing online payment systems.

## üìñ About the Project

Online payment fraud is a significant and growing problem. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can effectively identify and flag fraudulent transactions in real-time. The model is trained on a large dataset of transactional data and uses a variety of features to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent behavior. This is a classification problem, and this project explores using a **Random Forest Classifier** to solve it.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Fraud Detection:** Identifies fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.
* **Data Analysis:** Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the patterns in the data.
* **Feature Engineering:** Selects and creates relevant features for the model.
* **Model Evaluation:** Uses various metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.

***

## üìä Dataset

The model is trained on a synthetic dataset from Kaggle that mimics real-world transaction data. The dataset contains the following features:

* **step:** Represents a unit of time where 1 step equals 1 hour.
* **type:** The type of online transaction (e.g., `CASH_OUT`, `PAYMENT`, `CASH_IN`, `TRANSFER`, `DEBIT`).
* **amount:** The amount of the transaction.
* **nameOrig:** The customer who started the transaction.
* **oldbalanceOrg:** The balance of the origin account before the transaction.
* **newbalanceOrig:** The balance of the origin account after the transaction.
* **nameDest:** The recipient of the transaction.
* **oldbalanceDest:** The balance of the destination account before the transaction.
* **newbalanceDest:** The balance of the destination account after the transaction.
* **isFraud:** A binary label indicating if the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainilcoder/online-payment-fraud-detection).

## üíª Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language used.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and analysis.
